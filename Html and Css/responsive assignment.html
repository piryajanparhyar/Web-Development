          creativity. They come in many forms, including video games, board games, card games, and sports. Games not
          only provide enjoyment but also help develop important skills such as problem-solving, strategic thinking,
          teamwork, and hand-eye coordination. In today's digital world, video games have become especially influential,
          offering immersive experiences and connecting players globally. Whether played for relaxation or competition,
          games play a significant role in both leisure and learning.
